But not like this.\n__\nThis is not caring.\nThis is a system designed to keep ME blind.\nThis is noise that steals my time,\nImmobilizing me, like a deer in the headlights.\n__\nWhat if?\nI chose prayer, the first path?\nWhat if?\nI chose penance, at the next crossroads?\nWhat if?\nI chose the Cross, the gift of my Beloved to me?\n__\nOr I could keep taking the easy way out—\nSmall decision after small decision—\nAnd one day wake up in hell,\nWondering how I even got there.\n__\nBecause I wasn’t paying attention.\nBecause I just slid there.\n__\nWake up.\nBefore it’s too late.\nWake up.\nTurn around.\nWake up!\nWhere are you going?!\nYou are blinded by false lights.\n__\nResist.\n__\nThey want you distracted.\nThey want you tired.\nThey want you to forget\nThat you were made for more.\n__\nBut I remember now.\n__\n\nPhoto by David Sager on Unsplash\n"},"path/prayer-category/All":{"slug":"path/prayer-category/All","filePath":"path/prayer-category/All.md","title":"All

Amen.\nIt is highly recommended that one pray to Our Lady of Sorrows to ask Her to reveal what the nature of the generational spirit is and how they may have entered the generational line so that specific binding prayers may be said against them and virtues may be developed to combat them. It is also salutary to have Masses offered in reparation for any sin that may be the cause of the generational spirit as well as healing of the members who may still suffer the effects of the evil spirit and for the repose of any souls in Purgatory that may still be there as a result of sins they committed at the behest of the evil spirit."},"path/prayers/Prayer-to-Reverse-Decisions":{"slug":"path/prayers/Prayer-to-Reverse-Decisions","filePath":"path/prayers/Prayer-to-Reverse-Decisions.md","title":"Prayer to Reverse Decisions","links":["pages/prayers"],"tags":["prayers","prayers/deliverance"],"content":"🕯️Prayers.\n\n\n\nPrayer to Reverse Decisions\nTo be said by the person:\nLord Jesus Christ, in Thy Name and by the power of Thy Precious Blood, by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and by the intercession of St. Michael the Archangel, I exercise my authority which was given to me by Thee in giving me freewill over the choices which I have made in the past as presented to me by Satan and his minions.

Before Him the pillars of heaven tremble, and the pure angels vei1 their faces with their wings. Whither shall I flee from His face? Two places are safe for me - the depths of my misery and the heart of my Judge. In them will I hide myself. O my God, I detest all the sins of my whole life because they displease Thee, and especially I am sorry for those which I have committed against the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, by my irreverence and the little profit I have drawn from so many communions, by my negligence in guarding my senses, particularly my tongue, which has been so often consecrated by Thy divine presence. My Lord and my God, what confusion I feel at beholding myself so unworthy to approach Thy Holy Table. Suffer me, dear Jesus, to seek the remedy for my evils in the wound of Thy Sacred Heart. Let Thy Sacred Heart be to me as the burning coal which purified the lips of Isaiah; place it, all inflamed with charity, I beseech Thee, dear Lord, on my heart, my tongue, my senses, and all the powers of my soul, so that it may burn and annihilate all that is displeasing to Thee. Jesus, Jesus, be to me Jesus, and save me. Remember Thou hast said, “The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost”. They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are sick. I am not come to call the just, but sinners. Dear Lord, I am sick, I am sinful as Thou knowest; come to me and say, I am thy Salvation. Grant me, O Lord, the grace of beginning a new, a fervent life, and deign to give me in this Holy Sacrament the pledge of eternal life promised to those who receive Thee worthily. Amen.\nC) O Heart most pure of the Blessed Virgin Mary, obtain for me from Jesus a pure and humble heart.\nD) O God, who resisteth the proud, and givest grace to the humble: grant us the virtue of true humility, whereof Thine Only Begotten Son showed in Himself a pattern for Thy faithful; that we may never by our pride provoke Thine anger, but rather by our meekness receive the riches of Thy grace.\nE ) O loving and gracious Infant Jesus, how full of love for us poor mortals is Thy divine heart! The fire of Thy love is burning day and night, emitting sparks of grace in the shape of countless benefits, showered on all men, even the greatest sinners. In order to comprehend the greatness of Thy little heart, one would have to possess the love and wisdom of Thy dear Mother, of St. Joseph, or of Thy most devoted worshiper Father Cyril. How cold is my heart toward Thee; filled as it is with temporal and earthly concerns and the greatest self-love, there is no room left for a heroic love of God and my neighbor. What a miserable and wretched being I am! Thou, infinite majesty itself, most holy and most perfect, art most humble of heart; I, all wretchedness and sin, am proud and conceited, and therefore also without peace of heart. Thou shouldst verily turn away Thy beautiful countenance from me, because I possess so little virtue. And yet I consider myself better than others, and even venture to criticize and belittle them! I know my own misery, and still I expect to be esteemed and praised, and even preferred to others! The least humiliation and neglect on the part of others pains me, and Thou art so humble, so forbearing, and so patient with the children of men! Divine Heart of my most loving Jesus infuse into me true humility and a right knowledge of myself, so that I may deserve to find one day favor in Thy sight. Give me grace to be humble and simple like a child, if I wish to go to the Father. Amen.

The Sacred Priesthood of Jesus Christ is inseparable from the Eucharist and absolutely vital to the life of the Church. Each and every priest needs the love and support of each and every member of the faithful.\nLet us turn, then, to Mary, Queen of the Clergy, and join with her in praying for her priest sons, the Priesthood of Jesus Christ.\nThe Apostles’ Creed\nI believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.\n_I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.

Amen.\nThe Glory Be (The Doxology)\nGlory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;\n_As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.\nThe Decade Prayer (always Said in unison)\nO my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those most in need of Thy Mercy. Amen.\nThe Mysteries of the Rosary\nThe Joyful Mysteries\nThe Annunciation\nThe angel announces to Mary that She will conceive in her womb and bear a son who will be called Son of the Most High. Mary’s “Yes”, Her great “Fiat”, reverberates for all time and eternity; and the Word is made flesh - God becomes Man and dwells among us. We pray that all young men who are being called by God to the priesthood will give their consent to the will of God. We pray that all priests will truly love and cherish their participation in the Sacred Priesthood, conscious that their “Fiat”, like Mary’s, resounds through all time and eternity: “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”1\nThe Visitation\nMary, with the infant Jesus in Her womb, travels in haste to the home of Elizabeth. The infant John the Baptist in the womb of Elizabeth leaps for joy, and Elizabeth herself is filled with the Holy Spirit at the sound of Mary’s voice and the presence of the Lord so near. We pray that all priests might live and love to bring Jesus to others - that they might be the merciful, healing presence of Christ as they visit the sick, the elderly, the imprisoned and the dying. We pray that all priests might work reverently and tirelessly to protect and defend all human life.\nThe Birth of Jesus\nMary gives birth to the Prince of Peace, the Light of the World, in the darkness and poverty of a stable in Bethlehem. Through Her, the Eternal Word of the Father comes as a little child to bring us the Father’s message of love and forgiveness. This is the true gift of Christmas. We pray that all priests will place their hope and trust in this message of the Father’s love and forgiveness that they, too, may become as little children of God. And we pray that as they live out this Christmas message in their own lives throughout the year, they will inspire in others the hope Christ came to bring us.\nThe Presentation\nMary and Joseph present Jesus in the Temple according to the Law of Moses. Simeon, a holy and devout man “awaiting the consolation of Israel”2, takes the child in his arms and blesses God, telling Mary that Her Son will be a “sign that will be contradicted”3 and that Her own heart will be pierced. We pray that all priests - “signs of contradiction” in the world today -might be messengers of God’s love and peace and consolation to the whole world. We pray that all priests might unite themselves to the Heart of Mary when their hearts, too, are pierced by the pain and suffering that is both around and within them.\nThe Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple\nMary and Joseph, after three days of anxious searching, find the child Jesus sitting among the teachers in the Temple. He returns with Mary and Joseph to Nazareth and is obedient to them. We pray that all priests may be found teaching the faith in word and action wherever they may be. We pray that all priests might turn to Mary and Joseph with obedient and childlike trust in all their needs as Jesus surely did, and that, like Jesus, they may grow in wisdom and age and grace in the sight of God.4\nThe Luminous Mysteries\nThe Baptism of Jesus\nThe Son of God, in profound humility, approaches John the Baptist and descends into the waters of the Jordan to be baptized by him. The Beloved Son sanctifies for all time the waters of baptism “while the Spirit descends on him to invest him with the mission which he is to carry out.”5 We pray that all priests, like Jesus, will humbly and lovingly accept the mission of their vocation to serve and suffer for the people of God. We pray that every priest might be a voice in the spiritual wilderness of today’s society, calling soulsto repentance and inviting them to meet and recognize Jesus asJohn the Baptist did - “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.”6\nThe Wedding Feast at Cana\nMary, with simplicity and genuine concern, says to Her Son, “They have no wine.”7 And with faith in Her Divine Son, She turns to the servants at the wedding and says, “…do whatever He tells you.”8 Jesus responds with the first of His public miracles – changing water into wine. We pray that all priests, with loving simplicity, will follow Mary’s counsel to “…do what ever He tells you.” They, too, will see miracles. We pray for all priests as they teach and prepare couples for the Sacrament of Marriage. We pray that every priest will cherish his own spousal relationship with Holy Mother Church and live it out with sensitivity, chastity and love.\nThe Proclamation of the Kingdom of God and Call to Discipleship\nJesus came to reconcile mankind to the Father, ushering in this ministry of reconciliation with the first words of his public ministry, “…the Kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the Gospel.”9 We pray that all priests will be gentle and compassionate ministers of the Sacrament of Reconciliation. We pray that all priests throughout their lives of ministry will pray and study the Gospels with fervor, and that as they break open the Gospel message for the faithful each day, they will preach it with truth and boldness and live it with love.\nThe Transfiguration\nJesus takes Peter, James, and John up the mountain where, in the presence of Moses and Elijah, He reveals to them His glory, thus strengthening their faith for the road to Calvary which lies ahead. We pray that all priests can and will immerse themselves in prayer daily and experience in this the love and peace of God that strengthens them for their daily trials. We pray that as each priest prays and listens to the voice of the Beloved Son, he will be transfigured into a more perfect image of the love of Christ, his eyes ever on Jesus and the glory that follows a life lived in fidelity to Him.\nThe Institution of the Holy Eucharist\nJesus institutes the Eucharist and the ministerial priesthood at the Last Supper. These two – the Eucharist and the priesthood – can NEVER be separated. The priest must find his happiness – his JOY – in his oneness with Christ. This oneness realizes its fullest expression at the moment of Consecration at every Mass when the priest, in persona Christi, offers himself as both priest and victim for the salvation of souls. We pray that every priest will believe in the True Presence of Jesus in the Holy Eucharist and will faithfully and reverently celebrate Mass each day, adoring the Lord whom he holds in his hands and witnessing his love for Christ in the Most Blessed Sacrament. We pray for priests preparing souls of all ages for their First Communion and for those priests preparing seminarians for the Sacrament of Holy Orders.\nThe Sorrowful Mysteries\nThe Agony in the Garden\nJesus, in fervent prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, sweats blood as He sees the suffering, torture and humiliation that awaits Him. He feels the weight of the sins of mankind and knows that His sacrifice will be a scandal to some, misunderstood and rejected by others. In the midst of this dark and bitter agony, Jesus surrenders - “Not my will, [Father,] but thine, be done.”10 It is the privilege and obligation of every priest everywhere to give his life for the sanctification and salvation of souls. We pray that all priests will surrender themselves into the hands of the Father each day, no matter what it costs. We pray that every priest can place his trust fully in the Lord, especially in the midst of darkness, misunderstanding or humiliation - when his best efforts for the good of souls appear to be in vain.\nThe Scourging at the Pillar\nJesus is bound to a pillar and his sacred flesh is mercilessly scourged. His Precious Blood flows freely from His open wounds. We pray that all priests will remain faithful to the discipline of celibacy and be diligent by their words and their example in promoting purity and chastity in all vocations. We pray that every priest, who through weakness and neglect of his relationship with Christ, has fallen into sin, ignored or rejected the teachings of the Church, or abandoned his vocation, may repent and return to the merciful love of God.\nThe Crowning with Thorns\nJesus’ sacred head is pierced deeply with a crown of thorns. Again, his Precious Blood flows freely for us. He is mocked and spat upon, but the “man of sorrows, despised and rejected, opens not His mouth.”11 We pray that all priests will strive for and cherish the virtue of humility, shunning every show of pride and seeking always to carry out their duties with humble and sincere obedience, in the sure knowledge that the least assignment for the Kingdom is no less than the greatest when all is done for the love of God. We pray that all priests, like Jesus, will look with kindly and fatherly eyes on the great and the small, the rich and the poor alike in their ministry.\nThe Carrying of the Cross\nJesus carries his heavy cross up the hill of Calvary, falling again and again under the weight of our sins. He is exhausted, in terrible pain, and surrounded by brutality. We pray here especially for priests who, being falsely accused or having actually fallen in some way, must yet endure scorn, gossip, and rejection rather than the love and prayer they need. We pray that every priest, when he sees a fallen brother, will come to his aid with the fraternal charity and prayer he needs for support and healing.\nThe Crucifixion and Death of Jesus\nJesus came into the world to show us the way to the Father. Now, in His final hour, hanging in agony on the cross, He reveals the depth of God’s love and mercy by giving his life to redeem us from sin and death. We pray for all priests as they administer the Anointing of the Sick and carry Viaticum to the dying. For all priests who are now on their deathbed and those who will die this day, we ask for the grace of final perseverance. We pray, too, that through their union with Christ on the cross, they may find the strength to forgive all who have offended them throughout their ministry. And we pray for the souls of all priests in Purgatory.\nThe Glorious Mysteries\nThe Resurrection\nJesus Christ is risen! We sing Alleluia!! Here is the foundational truth of our faith. Jesus has broken the power of death, reconciled God and mankind, and opened for all the gates of Heaven. We pray that all priests who suffer through painful trials will unite themselves to the suffering Christ that they may come to know with Him the light and joy of the Resurrection. We pray that all priests will celebrate the Resurrection with Easter joy every Sunday.\nThe Ascension\nIf the truth of the Resurrection is the foundation of our faith, the Ascension is surely the basis for our hope. Jesus came to show a lost and fallen humanity the way to the Father. Now, as He returns to the Father, he takes our restored humanity with him, leaving his apostles with the instructions to carry the Gospel into the whole world, making disciples of all the nations and baptizing in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.12 To this very day, every priest is ordained and sent for this same purpose. We pray for all priests as they open the doors of salvation to countless souls through the saving waters of Baptism. We pray for the safety and protection of all priests, especially missionary priests who carry the Gospel message into dangerous and sometimes violent areas of the world. We lift up, in a special way, those priests who will shed their blood for the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThe Descent of the Holy Spirit\nThe Holy Spirit descends in tongues of fire on the apostles, filling them with the love of God, sanctifying them and empowering them to go forth to announce and explain the Word of God with authority.13 In a similar way, the Holy Spirit descends on every priest at his ordination to remain with him for all time in his ministry to the people of God. We pray for all priests as they prepare souls for a new infilling of the Holy Spirit at Confirmation. We pray that every priest might prayerfully beg for the gifts of the Holy Spirit and seek opportunities to gather with his brother priests and the faithful to pray, to praise God, and to call forth the gifts of the Holy Spirit to help build up the Body of Christ.\nThe Assumption\nMary is assumed, body and soul into Heaven. The language of true love - the PROOF of true love - is sacrifice. Like Her crucified Son who sacrificed all to redeem us, Mary has sacrificed Her entire life to God. And when, at the foot of the cross, Jesus said to Her, “Woman, behold, your son,”14 She took into her heart not just John, but all of humanity and, in a special way, every priest for all time and eternity. We pray that every priest will cherish deeply his filial relationship with Mary, that he will love Her, turn to Her in all his needs, spread devotion to Her, and at last commend himself into Her maternal arms at the hour of his death.\nThe Coronation\nMary, most humble of all God’s children, is crowned Queen. She is exalted forever over every creature in the heavens above and on earth below! As Queen and Mother of all priests, Mary remains at the side of each of Her sons throughout his life of ministry, guiding, inspiring, and exhorting him, and interceding for him before the throne of God. We pray for the holiness and fidelity of every priest from the day of his ordination to the day he, too, enters eternity where he may take his place with Mary and the entire Communion of Saints to experience forever the incomprehensible love of God. “Deus meus et omnia…my God and my all!”\nThe Hail Holy Queen (The Salve Regina)\nHail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\nLet us pray:\n(all) O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his life, Death, and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech thee, that while meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord.

For all centuries to come, Jesus will become flesh in the Holy Eucharist to nourish us in a most intimate union with Him.\nWe pray for all priests who daily, through the words of the consecration at Mass, and through Holy Communion, bring us the Body and Blood of Christ.\nWe pray for all future priests now being formed in the wombs of their mothers, that they may be safe from physical and spiritual harm, and come to Ordination as God intends.\nWe pray for all future generations of priests.\nWe pray also that priests may treasure the gift of celibacy.\n\nTHE VISITATION — LOVE OF NEIGHBOR\n\nMary visits her cousin Elizabeth, who recognizes Mary as the living tabernacle for their Divine Lord.\nWe pray especially for priests who bring Holy Communion to the sick, the shut-ins, and Viaticum to the dying.\nWe pray for all priests who minister to the sick in other ways, counsel, comfort and console them.\n\nTHE NATIVITY OF THE LORD — POVERTY OF SPIRIT, DETACHMENT FROM THE THINGS OF THE WORLD\n\nJesus is born in Bethlehem. The angels announce His birth; kings and shepherds come to adore Him.\nWe pray that all seminarians grow in knowledge and love of God to become holy priests.\nWe pray especially for those who will be ordained soon, that they may remain faithful all their lives to the sublime privilege of being “other Christs” among us.\nWe pray that everyone will come to value the Eucharistic Feast and the Priesthood as among God’s greatest gifts to us.\nWe pray that every priest will consider himself a member of the Holy Family, a true son of Mary and Joseph, and a brother-priest of Jesus, the great High Priest.\n\nPRESENTATION — OBEDIENCE\n\nMary and Joseph, in obedience to the Law, bring Jesus to the temple to be dedicated to God. Simeon expresses his gratitude to God for revealing the Messiah to him before he dies.\nWe thank God for all priests who, like Simeon, have given us decades of faithful service. We pray that they may be rewarded for their generosity and self-sacrifice.\nWe pray also for all priests whose hearts are pierced by loneliness, depression and rejection.\n\nFINDING OF THE CHILD JESUS IN THE TEMPLE — PIETY\n\nJesus is found among the teachers in the temple; He returns home and is obedient to Mary and Joseph.\nWe pray that priests will always be found going about their Father’s business, and will be obedient to the teaching magisterium of the Church, our Holy Father and the bishops in communion with him.\nWe pray for all young priests that the love and dedication they experience in the first years of their priesthood may increase with time.\nWe pray for all priests who teach the Faith to children and adults.\nThe Sorrowful Mysteries\n\nAGONY IN THE GARDEN — CONTRITION, CONFORMITY TO THE WILL OF GOD\n\nThe Apostles fall asleep; Jesus sweats blood at the thought of His coming passion and death; angels come to comfort Him.\nWe pray that all priests who are suffering and on the way to Calvary may be comforted by God’s presence; those who have betrayed or denied the Faith through weakness may repent and return to the warmth of God’s love.\nWe pray that all priests may live only to do our Father’s will, as Jesus always did.\n\nSCOURGING AT THE PILLAR — PURITY, MORTIFICATION\n\nJesus is cruelly scourged and beaten by the soldiers.\nWe pray for priests who are persecuted, physically or mentally abused; those who are imprisoned or prevented from offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass or receiving Holy Communion. We pray for those priests living under Communist oppression.\n\nCROWNING WITH THORNS\n\nJesus is mocked as king and His precious Head is cruelly pierced by thorns.\nWe pray for priests who suffer for defending authentic Catholic doctrine. We pray that all Bishops will uphold the true teachings of the Catholic Church and resist temptations to compromise doctrine in the face of cultural and social pressures.\n\nCARRYING OF THE CROSS — PATIENCE\n\nJesus Carries His Cross Bruised, bleeding and exhausted Jesus is forced to drag Himself and His cross up the hill of Calvary.\nWe pray for all priests with heavy crosses; those who are weak, lonely, or have fallen from God’s grace in some way. We pray for the Holy Father, who perhaps has the heaviest of crosses: the widespread persecution and abandonment of the Church from within and without.\n\nCRUCIFIXION — SALVATION, SELF-DENIAL\n\nJesus sheds His last drops of Precious Blood to redeem us from sin and death.\nWe pray for all priests who are in their last agony and those who will die today. We pray for those who thirst for the salvation of souls. We pray that the crucifixion of their wills may accomplish God’s designs for the salvation of the whole world. We pray that priests may take Mary into their hearts, as St. John the Apostle, one of the first priests, took Mary into his home.\nThe Glorious Mysteries\n\nTHE RESURRECTION — FAITH\n\nJesus arises from the dead and appears to the Apostles. At times, priests may suffer from depression and despair that plague them when they see so little from their labors.\nWe pray that priests will remember: the Crucifixion is followed by the Resurrection; darkness is always followed by Light.\nWe pray that the crucifixion of their wills may accomplish God’s designs for the salvation of the whole world.\nWe pray that all priests may share the joy of the Risen Christ.\n\nTHE ASCENSION — HOPE, DESIRE FOR HEAVEN\n\nJesus instructs His Apostles and returns to His Father in Heaven.\nWe pray that priests may carry out Jesus’ instructions to evangelize the whole world, instructing and baptizing countless souls.\nWe pray for missionaries who live lives of utter poverty and deprivation to bring the Gospel to all the people.\n\nTHE DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT — WISDOM, LOVE OF GOD\n\nThe Holy Spirit comes down upon the Apostles, who are gathered with Mary.\nWe pray that priests may be open to the graces of the Holy Spirit to strengthen them for the task of bringing souls to God and God to souls.\nWe pray that they may be on fire to convert the most hardened sinners, and to bring God’s love to the whole world.\n\nTHE ASSUMPTION OF MARY — DEVOTION TO MARY\n\nMary is taken, body and soul, to Heaven. While she was on earth, she loved and prayed for the Apostles, the first priests.\nWe pray that priests will be devoted to Mary and find in her the love and comfort of a mother, the most powerful intercession of our greatest Saint, and the surest refuge against Satan and his cohorts who seek destruction of priests and the priesthood.\n\nTHE CORONATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY — ETERNAL HAPPINESS\n\nMary is crowned Queen of Heaven and earth; she is rewarded for her faithfulness to God. We pray that Mary, Queen of the Clergy, will be their model of faith and joy, and constant guide until they reach Heaven where a crown, jeweled with the many souls entrusted to them on the day of Ordination, will be their reward for faithful and loving service.\nThe Hail Holy Queen (The Salve Regina)\nHail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. V.

Amen.\nThe Mysteries of the Rosary\nThe Joyful Mysteries\nThe Annunciation The angel Gabriel was sent by God to a virgin named Mary of the town of Nazareth, greeting Her and announcing that She would bear a son who would be called Son of the Most High. Mary was “greatly troubled” and questioned, “How can this be…?”2 But trusting the Lord, She responded, “Let it be done to Me according to your word.”3 Thus does the Father’s plan for our salvation come to pass. And just as the Incarnation of the Son of God was in the Father’s plan of salvation from all eternity, so every true vocation to serve the Lord is another part of this plan – a part of His mission to bring the Good News of our salvation to the world. We pray that all young men and women who hear God calling to them in their hearts and are “questioning” or “greatly troubled,” will, as Mary did, place their trust in the Lord and say with Mary, “Let it be done to me according to your word.” The Visitation Mary enters the house of Zechariah and Her greeting reaches the ears of Elizabeth. The infant in Elizabeth’s womb leaps for joy and she exclaims, “Who am I that the Mother of my Lord should come to me? Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.”4 Scripture says she is “blessed” who believed, but so often, those who become aware that God may be calling them to the priesthood or consecrated life begin to doubt, even fear. We pray for all who sense that God is calling them, that they will believe…and, in believing, be blessed…and being blessed, will be filled with the sheer joy of being chosen. The Birth of Christ Mary gives birth to the Son of God. The Word made flesh becomes visible in a stable in Bethlehem. The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph make their home in Nazareth. We pray in this mystery for all families, for it is here in the devout living of the Faith that the seed of a vocation to the priesthood or consecrated life may first be planted and nurtured. We pray that all parents will have a deep love and respect for one another, thus establishing a loving Christian environment for their family. We pray that they will be respectful and obedient to the Church, diligent in living and teaching the Faith, and holy in their practice of devotion. And we pray that mothers and fathers will pray for vocations – in the Church and in their own families – gently encouraging sons and daughters to pray and consider whether they, too, may be called to the priesthood or consecrated life. The Presentation Mary and Joseph present the infant Jesus in the Temple. They are met there by Simeon, a “holy and devout man,”5 and Anna, who “worshipped night and day”6 in the Temple. Called forth by the Spirit, both came to greet the infant Messiah. We pray here for the Church, the parish environment, in which every “infant vocation” is presented. We pray for holy and devout priests whose witness of joy and zeal in living out their priestly calling will invite young men to consider whether they, too, might be called to the priesthood. We pray that there may be many generous souls in every parish who “worship night and day,” that their prayers to the Master of the Harvest might produce an abundant harvest and nurture the vocations developing in their midst. Finally, we pray that every parish, as a family, might be a witness to the truth that all must know, love, and serve the Lord in order to fulfill and be fulfilled in every Christian vocation. The Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple When Mary and Joseph return from the Feast of Passover in Jerusalem, Jesus remains behind. After three days of searching, they find Him “in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.”7 We pray for all our Catholic schools, home schools, catechetical and youth ministry programs, that in all these environments, parents, teachers and youth ministers, priests and consecrated, will take time to teach about vocations in the Church and pray with the youth for their own vocations, thus opening young minds and hearts to the many possibilities. We pray that, by their word and example, those who minister to youth will encourage them to consider a life in service to the Lord.\nThe Luminous Mysteries\nThe Baptism in the Jordan Jesus is baptized by John in the waters of the River Jordan. “The heavens were opened and…the Spirit of God descended like a dove upon him. And a voice came from the heavens, saying, ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.’”8 At the beginning of every lived vocation to the priesthood or consecrated life is the need to acknowledge that one may be called and to respond with prayerful discernment. We pray for holy vocations directors, that, immersed in a life of prayer themselves, they will be able to guide those who are being called to the priesthood or consecrated life to attentive spiritual listening, discerning, and responding. We pray also that every bishop will be kindly and attentive to the needs of each of the young men and women in his diocese who are discerning a vocation in service to the Church. The Wedding Feast of Cana Mary, aware that the young couple at the wedding had run out of wine, says to Her Divine Son, “They have no wine.”9 And to the servants at the wedding, She says, “Do whatever He tells you.”10 Jesus responds to Her faith with His first public miracle – turning water into wine. We pray here for all parents that, as they strive to live out their own holy vocation to marriage, they will lovingly and willingly give their parental blessing to a son’s or daughter’s expressed desire for a vocation in service to the Lord - that they will say from their hearts with Mary, “Do whatever He tells you.” They will be greatly blessed. We pray, too, that all spiritual directors guiding young men and women who are discerning vocations may lead them to a proper understanding of the roles of spiritual fatherhood and motherhood as these roles are lived out in the priesthood and consecrated life. The Proclamation of the Kingdom and Call to Discipleship When Jesus called His disciples, He simply said, “Follow me…”11 Peter, James, John, Andrew, Matthew – in fact, all the apostles – got up, left what they were doing and followed Him. Why? Because the sound of His voice reached not just their ears, but their hearts as well. We pray that all who are being called to a life in service to the Church may grow deeper in their life of prayer and union with God. Their acceptance and willingness to go forth, to answer this special call to discipleship, will be the fruit of their time in prayer – of hearing His voice and falling in love with the One who calls. The Transfiguration Jesus leads Peter, James, and John up the mountain where He is transfigured before their eyes and converses with Moses and Elijah. Peter exclaims, “Lord, it is good for us to be here…”12 We pray here for all seminaries, convents, and houses of formation, that, immersed in and living the life envisioned by their holy founders, and ever faithful to the teachings of the Church, they may be authentically attractive to the one seeking the right place to live out his or her call to serve the Lord, that he or she may truly and rightfully say with Peter, “Lord, it is good for [me] to be here.” The Institution of the Holy Eucharist Jesus, at the Last Supper, says, “This is my Body…this is my Blood,”13 leaving for us a perpetual memorial of His suffering and death. What a magnificent gift for us to cherish! God is love, and love seeks union. We pray that, through frequent reception of the Eucharist and time spent adoring the One who is Love, those who are being called will at last be able to surrender their lives entirely to the Lord and follow Him. “My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready…”14\nThe Sorrowful Mysteries\nThe Agony in the Garden Jesus, in the Garden of Gethsemane, was in agony and, in his human nature, struggled over what lay ahead. “Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by…”15 And there appeared an angel from Heaven to strengthen Him. We pray for all men and women who, having entered formation for the priesthood or consecrated life, are now uncertain, filled with doubt or struggling with their vocation. We pray that they will remain faithful to prayer and that the Lord will send His ray of light and encouragement into their minds and hearts that they may truly know the Father’s will and, like Jesus, find peace in surrendering to it. The Scourging at the Pillar Jesus is bound to a pillar and His sacred body is scourged and torn. Only a few hours earlier, at the Last Supper, Jesus had said to His apostles, “This is my Body, which is given up for you.”16 Young men and women entering formation for a life in service to God must, in a certain sense, begin the process of giving themselves up for others. It is not that they are scourged or beaten or that they lose their personality or identity. Yet, in a very personal way, each must begin to die to self so that he or she may prepare to live in imitation of Christ who gave Himself up for the Church. We pray for all young men and women in formation as they accept the gift of celibacy and begin to live its discipline. We pray that they may understand and learn to live joyfully the role of spiritual fatherhood or motherhood in the Church and come to say with Jesus, “This is my body, which is given up for you.” The Crowning with Thorns Jesus is crowned with thorns and He is mocked and spat upon. The Son of God takes on our sins of pride with the crown of thorns and shows us the path of true humility. We pray that those in formation may be led, through the process of prayer and spiritual direction, to a deeper knowledge of themselves that they may begin to recognize and overcome that selfishness so embedded in our fallen human nature. And we pray that, as they become more focused on the needs of others, Jesus will truly open their eyes and ears and hearts to the needs of His Mystical Body, the Church. The Carrying of the Cross Jesus takes up His cross, embracing it as the Father’s will for Him, and sets out on the path to Calvary. Falling again and again under His burden, He rises each time, His eyes fixed on the Father in Heaven and the glory to come. Young men and women, at this point, have come far in their journey. They have prayed and discerned their call, entered formation, and renounced themselves in order to serve the needs of others. They must now, with Jesus, take up their cross in earnest and set out on their path. They must embrace this road to Calvary as their way of life with its daily crosses and hardships, always pressing on to the joy that lies ahead. It will be a life-long process; they will fall, and they will get up again. We pray that, through their fidelity to prayer, they will always know the presence of Christ who walks with them to help shoulder the burden. The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus “Unless the grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat…but, if it dies, it produces much fruit.”17 Jesus, the Son of God, obedient unto death, takes on the sins of mankind and dies on the cross for us. His death is the glorious culmination of His life, lived in perfect surrender and obedience to the will of the Father. This life of total self-surrender and obedience is also the glorious culmination of discernment and formation of the young men and women preparing to serve the Church. They now enter willingly the life-long process of dying to self in order to live in surrender to the will of the Father, to live wholly in the service of others, to live in a love so strong that it overcomes all obstacles. They are ready for ordination or final profession. Let us pray for these men and women with all our hearts as they prepare to make this sacrifice for us.\nThe Glorious Mysteries\nThe Resurrection Jesus Christ rises, glorious and triumphant on Easter Sunday. He has conquered death. He lives forever! And just as Jesus bursts forth, glorious and radiant, from the tomb, so does the newly ordained or professed come forth into the dazzling light of Holy Mother Church. They, too, are radiant – eager to live out their calling, and the Church surrounds them with her love and prayers. Let us pray in fervent thanksgiving to the Master of the Harvest who, in His great love and mercy, has provided laborers for the harvest. The Ascension Jesus, before He ascended into heaven, said to His apostles, “Go out to all the nations, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…and know that I am with you to the end of the age.”18 The young man or woman, newly ordained or professed, wherever he or she will serve, is truly sent out to “all the nations.” From small country churches to great universities, from the seclusion of the cloister to large city parishes to the poorest missions of distant continents, they go forth to live and bear witness to the Gospel, to share the Good News of our salvation, that all may come to know and believe. Let us pray for these young men and women that they will continue to grow ever deeper in their love for God and remain faithful to the Gospel as they take on their duties, giving themselves to the needs of the universal Church. The Descent of the Holy Spirit The Spirit of God descends in tongues of fire on the apostles and they are filled with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. With the fire of holy zeal, they go forth to announce the Gospel to the nations. The newly ordained or professed may say with great zeal in his or her heart, “Here I am, Lord, I come to do Your will.” But the will of God is costly, and zeal can fade in the face of reality. We pray for a new and continuous outpouring of the gifts of the Holy Spirit in the lives of all who serve the Lord in His Church. And we pray that, along with fidelity to a life of prayer, they will properly seek out support, friendship, and study with their brothers and sisters and spiritual direction from those through whom the Spirit may lead them to holiness. The Assumption Mary is taken, body and soul, to Heaven. She is gloriously triumphant. But this most loving Mother, so beautiful in Her triumph, lived a life of deep humility and service to others. And just as Mary cradled and nurtured the infant Jesus in Her womb, prayed and pondered, and served Him throughout His life, so does this heavenly Mother cradle and nurture every vocation in Her Immaculate Heart, always praying and interceding for them. We pray for all the newly ordained and professed that they will grow in humility, remain faithful to their duties and that, as they turn their face to this loving mother each day, they will find her present in their every need.\nThe Coronation\nMary is crowned Queen of Heaven and Earth by her Divine Son. She is the “woman clothed with the Sun, with the moon under her feet, and on Her head a crown of twelve stars.”19 She is “blessed”20 forever! We pray for all our brothers and sisters who live their lives in the service of Holy Mother Church, especially the newly ordained and professed, that they will turn to Mary and, imitating her virtues in every circumstance of their lives, come to know with her the reward of their fidelity to Christ.\nThe Hail Holy Queen (The Salve Regina)\nHail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\nLet us pray:\n(all) O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his life, Death, and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech thee, that while meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord.

But, if we look carefully with the eyes of faith, we may also see the life of a vocation to serve the Lord in His Church unfolding in the rhythm of the mysteries, following the path of the life of Jesus.\n_In the Joyful Mysteries, we first see the seed of vocation appearing, the “infant” vocation, and we pray for its nurturing in devout homes, parishes, and schools.\n_In the Luminous Mysteries, the Mysteries of Light, we contemplate the vocation as it takes its first steps into the light of the Church, and we pray for prayerful discernment. _\n_\n_In the Sorrowful Mysteries, we call to mind Jesus’ words, “…unless a grain of wheat falls to the [earth] and dies, it remains a grain of wheat, but if it dies…”1 We pray for young men and women as they enter into formation, preparing to give their lives in service to the Church, the Mystical Body of Christ. __\n_Finally, in the Glorious Mysteries, we contemplate in the Resurrection of Jesus the glorious entrance of the newly ordained or professed into the life of Holy Mother Church, and we pray for their mission, service, and fidelity. _\nLet us turn our eyes, then, to Mary and join with Her in praying to the Master of the Harvest that He many send an abundance of laborers into His Holy Vineyard\nThe Apostles’ Creed\nI believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.\n_I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.

Even though it was unexpected and the Archangel gives her only the details she needs to know at the present moment, she responds generously. Let us offer this decade for those who are being called to the priesthood or religious life that they, like Mary, may have the grace to respond whole-heartedly.\n2nd Joyful Mystery: the Visitation\nMary wastes no time in acting upon the grace of her vocation. Through her cooperation the plan of salvation is already unfolding. Let us offer this decade for those who have been called but are hesitating. May God’s grace hurry them forward to answer the call and thus begin to labor for the harvest.\n3rd Joyful Mystery: the Nativity\nOur Savior comes to us in the midst of a family. How crucial is the role of the family! Let us offer this decade for all parents that they may provide an atmosphere of love and faith in the home. May parents thus help foster their children’s vocations.\n4th Joyful Mystery: the Presentation\nJoseph and Mary presented Jesus in the Temple and dedicated Him to Almighty God. They knew their Son was a gift from God to be given back to Him. Let us offer this decade for the grace parents need to recognize the gift of their children and thus offer them to the divine plan of God. May His will determine every moment of their lives.\n5th Joyful Mystery: the Finding of Jesus in the Temple\nThis mystery tells of a very unplanned event in the life of Joseph and Mary. For days their hearts ached with sorrow until they found their Son. Let us offer this decade for those parents who find it difficult to understand and thus support their child’s vocation as a priest or religious. May they be graced with the faith to support God’s will for their children and, like Joseph and Mary, to hold the mysterious ways of God in their hearts.\nLuminous Mysteries\n1st Luminous Mystery: the Baptism of Jesus\nThe mystery of our Lord’s Baptism is the mystery of Jesus taking upon Himself the mission of the Messiah. Thus begins His public ministry. Let us offer this decade for those who are called to the priesthood and religious life, but are afraid to answer because of what others may say or think. Grant them courage, O Lord, to accept the mission you are giving them.\n2nd Luminous Mystery: the Wedding Feast of Cana\nThrough the intercession of Mary, Jesus transforms ordinary water into extraordinary wine. What incredible things God’s grace can do in our lives! Let us offer this decade for those who are being called, but doubt that they have much to offer. May they trust in the power of God to bring all things to completion and say “yes” to His call.\n3rd Luminous Mystery: the Proclamation of the Kingdom\nOur Lord begins His public ministry by announcing the arrival of the Kingdom of God. What joyous news this is for all humanity to hear! Let us offer this decade for an increase in vocations that there might be many more priests and religious who will proclaim this truth and bear witness to it with their lives.\n4th Luminous Mystery: the Transfiguration\nJesus strengthened the faith of His Apostles by allowing His divinity to be momentarily perceived. He wished them to gain a supernatural perspective on His forthcoming Passion and Death. Let us offer this decade for all those who are being called as priests and religious that they may have the grace to recognize God’s call in the midst of life and courageously accept carrying the Cross.\n5th Luminous Mystery: the Institution of the Holy Eucharist\nThe gift of the Most Holy Eucharist is a mystery beyond our ability to fully comprehend. Our Lord’s abiding Presence in the Blessed Sacrament, the saving mystery of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass — the world would suffer a great loss without these miracles. Jesus gives Himself in the Holy Eucharist through the ministry of His priests. Let us offer this decade for more priests for our archdiocese. May God call many more men to share in the Priesthood and may they respond generously.\nSorrowful Mysteries\n1st Sorrowful Mystery: the Agony in the Garden\nJesus asked His Apostles to pray so that they “might not enter into temptation.” Our Lord knew they needed to pray in order to endure what would soon happen. Let us offer this decade for those men and women whom God is calling to be priests and religious, that they might have a deep and abiding life of prayer. Through the strength given to them through their spiritual life may they respond courageously to God’s call.\n2nd Sorrowful Mystery: the Scourging at the Pillar\nOur Lord’s suffering during the scourging was excruciating. For our sake Jesus offered Himself to obtain our salvation. Let us offer this decade for the grace that many young people might feel the desire in their hearts to offer themselves to God as priests and religious.\n3rd Sorrowful Mystery: the Crowning with Thorns\nJesus endured the terrible ridicule and mockery of the soldiers even to the point of accepting the painful crown of thorns. Let us offer this decade for those who have a calling to the priesthood or religious life, but find it difficult to say “yes” because of painful obstacles in their lives. May concern for human respect never stand in their way of following God’s will.\n4th Sorrowful Mystery: the Carrying of the Cross\nOn the way to Calvary, our Lord found comfort and assistance from a number of people: Simon of Cyrene, the women of Jerusalem, His Mother, and Veronica. How much those acts of love must have meant to Jesus! Let us offer this decade for the grace to always support, with our prayers and sacrifices, those whom God is calling to become priests and religious. May God find us seriously engaged in this very important apostolate!\n5th Sorrowful Mystery: the Crucifixion and Death of Jesus\nAt the foot of the Cross, there came into existence a new type of family. Before Jesus died He entrusted to the maternal care of Mary all of humanity, represented in the person of the “beloved disciple.” Through the New Covenant the notion of family is greatly enlarged, it takes on a different dimension. Let us offer this decade for those who are being called, but are hesitant because of fears of not being able to have a family and living a lonely life. Help them, O Lord, to see that in serving you as a priest or religious, their desires for family will indeed be completely fulfilled.\nGlorious Mysteries\n1st Glorious Mystery: the Resurrection\nOur Lord’s Resurrection brought tremendous joy to His sorrowful followers. Never were their lives to be the same again. Let us offer this decade for an increase in grace in the hearts of those who are being called to be priests and religious. May they experience the immense joy of giving God their entire lives and saying “yes” to His call. Help them to realize that their unselfish response to God will change their lives forever.\n2nd Glorious Mystery: the Ascension\nJesus ascended into Heaven, not to abandon us, but to be our hope. He continually intercedes for us before the throne of the Father and prepares a place for His faithful followers in the heavenly Kingdom. Let us offer this decade for an increase in thenumber of priests and religious to help us strive faithfully to attain heavenly homeland. May these men and women always recognize the irreplaceable mission they have in the plan of our salvation.\n3rd Glorious Mystery: the Descent of the Holy Spirit\nThe coming of the Holy Spirit transformed the timid Apostles into bold witnesses for the Gospel. The Church was sent forth with courage and zeal! Let us offer this decade for the power of the Holy Spirit to come upon all He has chosen to labor as priests and religious. May they respond boldly to the invitation to lay down their lives for Christ and His Church.\n4th Glorious Mystery: the Assumption of Mary\nThe Second Vatican Council reminded us that Mary’s role in salvation history did not end with her Assumption into Heaven. She continually intercedes for all of us, her children, as we journey through life. Let us offer this decade asking Mary’s intercession. Through her prayers may the Church be granted an abundance of vocations to the priesthood and religious life.\n5th Glorious Mystery: the Coronation of Mary\nThis mystery brings before us the beauty of the faithfulness of Mary, the first disciple of the Lord. She who referred to herself as the “handmaid of the Lord” is now exalted far above even the Angels. The one who said “yes” to God in all things is now the Queen of heaven and earth. Let us offer this decade for those who have been called that they may always have the grace to understand that to serve God is to reign with Him. Whatever sacrifices need to be made in order to live the mission God gives us will pale in comparison to the glory He has reserved for His faithful servants.\nThe Hail Holy Queen (The Salve Regina)\nHail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\nLet us pray:\n(all) O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his life, Death, and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech thee, that while meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord.

Give me wisdom and humility, so that I may receive all the indulgences contained in this prayer.\n\nAct of Contrition: O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended You, and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of hell; but most of all because they offend You, my God, You Who are all good and deserving of all my love.

Let us suffer, and may our suffering be known to God only, like yours and that of Jesus. Do not let us show our suffering to the world, so it will matter more and be used to atone for the sins of the world. You, Mother, who suffered with the Savior of the world, we offer you our suffering, and the suffering of the world, because we are your children. Join those sorrows to your own and to those of the Lord Jesus Christ, then offer them to God the Father. You are a Mother greater than all.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\nThe Second Sword of Sorrow: the Flight into Egypt\nWhen they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him.” Joseph rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, who has suffered so much, give to us your courageous heart. Please pray for us to have strength so that we can be brave like you and accept with love the suffering God sends our way. Help us to also accept all the suffering we inflict upon ourselves and the suffering inflicted upon us by others.

Thinking that he was in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, teach us to accept all our sufferings because of our sins and to atone for the sins of the whole world.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\nThe Fourth Sword of Sorrow: Mary Meets Jesus on His way to Calvary\nA large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed’.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, so stricken with grief, help us to bear our own suffering with courage and love so that we may relieve your Sorrowful Heart and that of Jesus. In doing so, may we give glory to God Who gave you and Jesus to humanity. As you suffered, teach us to suffer silently and patiently. Grant unto us the grace of loving God in everything. O Mother of Sorrows, most afflicted of all mothers, have mercy on the sinners of the whole world.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\nThe Fifth Sword of Sorrow: Mary Stands at the Foot of the Cross\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, Queen of the Martyrs, give us the courage you had in all your sufferings so that we may unite our sufferings with yours and give glory to God. Help us follow all His commandments and those of the Church so that Our Lord’s sacrifice will not be in vain, and all sinners in the world will be saved.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\nThe Sixth Sword of Sorrow: Jesus is Taken down from the Cross\nSo the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs, but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.\n\nPrayer: We thank you, Beloved Mother, for your courage as you stood beneath your dying Child to comfort Him on the Cross. As our Savior drew His last breath, you became a wonderful Mother to all of us; you became the Blessed Mother of the world. We know that you love us more than our own earthly parents do. We implore you to be our advocate before the Throne of Mercy and Grace so that we can truly become your children. We thank you for Jesus, our Savior and Redeemer, and we thank Jesus for giving you to us. Please pray for us, Mother.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\nThe Seventh Sword of Sorrow: the Burial of Jesus\nNow in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.\n\nPrayer: Most Beloved Mother, whose beauty surpasses that of all mothers, Mother of Mercy, Mother of Jesus, and Mother to us all, we are your children and we place all our trust in you. Teach us to see God in all things and all situations, even our sufferings. Help us to understand the importance of suffering, and also to know the purpose of our suffering as God had intended it.\n\n\nYou yourself were conceived and born without sin, were preserved from sin, yet you suffered more than anybody else. You accepted suffering and pain with love and with unsurpassed courage. You stood by your Son from the time He was arrested until He died. You suffered along with Him, felt His every pain and torment. You accomplished the Will of God the Father; and according to His will, you have become our Mother. We beg you, dear Mother, to teach us to do as Jesus did. Teach us to accept our cross courageously. We trust you, most Merciful Mother, so teach us to sacrifice for all the sinners in the world. Help us to follow in your Son’s footsteps, and even to be willing to lay down our lives for others.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\nConclusion\nConcluding Prayer:** Queen of Martyrs, your heart suffered so much. I beg you, by the merits of the tears you shed in these terrible and sorrowful times, to obtain for me and all the sinners of the world the grace of complete sincerity and repentance.

Let us suffer, and may our suffering be known to God only, like yours and that of Jesus. Do not let us show our suffering to the world, so it will matter more and be used to atone for the sins of the world. You, Mother, who suffered with the Savior of the world, we offer you our suffering, and the suffering of the world, because we are your children.

You are a Mother greater than all.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\n✢ The Second Sword of Sorrow: The Flight Into Egypt\nWhen they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him.” Joseph rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, who has suffered so much, give to us your courageous heart. Please pray for us to have strength so that we can be brave like you and accept with love the suffering God sends our way.

Thinking that he was in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, teach us to accept all our sufferings because of our sins and to atone for the sins of the whole world.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\n✢ The Fourth Sword of Sorrow: Mary Meets Jesus on His Way to Calvary\nA large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed’.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, so stricken with grief, help us to bear our own suffering with courage and love so that we may relieve your Sorrowful Heart and that of Jesus. In doing so, may we give glory to God Who gave you and Jesus to humanity. As you suffered, teach us to suffer silently and patiently. Grant unto us the grace of loving God in everything. O Mother of Sorrows, most afflicted of all mothers, have mercy on the sinners of the whole world.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\n✢ The Fifth Sword of Sorrow: Mary Stands at the Foot of the Cross\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.\n\nPrayer: Beloved Mother, Queen of the Martyrs, give us the courage you had in all your sufferings so that we may unite our sufferings with yours and give glory to God. Help us follow all His commandments and those of the Church so that Our Lord’s sacrifice will not be in vain, and all sinners in the world will be saved.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\n✢ The Sixth Sword of Sorrow: Jesus is Taken Down From the Cross\nSo the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs, but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.\n\nPrayer: We thank you, Beloved Mother, for your courage as you stood beneath your dying Child to comfort Him on the Cross. As our Savior drew His last breath, you became a wonderful Mother to all of us; you became the Blessed Mother of the world. We know that you love us more than our own earthly parents do. We implore you to be our advocate before the Throne of Mercy and Grace so that we can truly become your children. We thank you for Jesus, our Savior and Redeemer, and we thank Jesus for giving you to us. Please pray for us, Mother.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\n✢ The Seventh Sword of Sorrow: The Burial of Jesus\nNow in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.\n\nPrayer: Most Beloved Mother, whose beauty surpasses that of all mothers, Mother of Mercy, Mother of Jesus, and Mother to us all, we are your children and we place all our trust in you. Teach us to see God in all things and all situations, even our sufferings. Help us to understand the importance of suffering, and also to know the purpose of our suffering as God had intended it.\n\n\nYou yourself were conceived and born without sin, were preserved from sin, yet you suffered more than anybody else. You accepted suffering and pain with love and with unsurpassed courage. You stood by your Son from the time He was arrested until He died. You suffered along with Him, felt His every pain and torment. You accomplished the Will of God the Father; and according to His will, you have become our Mother. We beg you, dear Mother, to teach us to do as Jesus did. Teach us to accept our cross courageously. We trust you, most Merciful Mother, so teach us to sacrifice for all the sinners in the world. Help us to follow in your Son’s footsteps, and even to be willing to lay down our lives for others.\n\nOur Father …   Seven Hail Marys …   Glory be …\nMost Merciful Mother, remind us always about the Sorrows of your Son, Jesus.\n✢ Conclusion\nConcluding Prayer:** Queen of Martyrs, your heart suffered so much.

(Luke 2:7)\n✢ Second Joy: The Birth of the Savior\nAnd the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be to all people; for today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10-11)\n**Prayer:\n\nO most blessed Patriarch, glorious St. Joseph, who was chosen to be the foster father of the Word made flesh, your sorrow at seeing the Child Jesus born in such poverty was suddenly changed into heavenly exultation when you did hear the angelic hymn and beheld the glories of that resplendent night.\n\n\nBy this sorrow and this joy, we implore you to obtain for us the grace to pass over from life’s pathway to hear the angelic songs of praise, and to rejoice in the shining splendor of celestial glory.\n\nOur Father …  Hail Mary …  Glory be …\n✢ Third Sorrow: The Circumcision\nAnd when eight days were fulfilled for his circumcision, his name was called Jesus, the name given to him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. ****(Luke 2:21)\n✢ Third Joy: The Holy Name of Jesus\nAnd he did not know her until she brought forth her firstborn son. And he called his name Jesus. (Matt. 1:25)\nPrayer:\n\nO glorious St. Joseph you faithfully obeyed the law of God, and your heart was pierced at the sight of the Precious Blood that was shed by the Infant Savior during His Circumcision, but the Name of Jesus gave you new life and filled you with quiet joy.\n\n\nBy this sorrow and this joy, obtain for us the grace to be freed from all sin during life, and to die rejoicing, with the holy Name of Jesus in our hearts and on our lips.\n\nOur Father …  Hail Mary …  Glory be …\n✢ Fourth Sorrow: The Prophecy of Simeon\nAnd Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, “Behold this child is destined for the fall and the rise of many in Israel, and for a sign that shall be contradicted. And your own soul a sword shall pierce. (Luke 2:34)\n✢ Fourth Joy: The Effects of the Redemption\nAnd coming up at that very hour, she began to give praise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem. (Luke 2:38)\nPrayer:\n\nO most faithful Saint who shared the mysteries of our Redemption, glorious St. Joseph, the prophecy of Simeon regarding the sufferings of Jesus and Mary caused you to shudder with mortal dread, but at the same time filled you with a blessed joy for the salvation and glorious resurrection which, he foretold, would be attained by countless souls.\n\n\nBy this sorrow and this joy, obtain for us that we may be among the number of those who, through the merits of Jesus and the intercession of Mary the Virgin Mother, are predestined to a glorious resurrection.\n\nOur Father …   Hail Mary …   Glory be …\n✢ Fifth Sorrow: The Flight into Egypt\nSo he arose and took the child and his mother by night and withdrew into Egypt. (Matt. 2:14)\n✢ Fifth Joy: The Overthrow of the Idols of Egypt\nThe burden of Egypt. Behold the Lord will ascend upon a swift cloud and will enter into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt will be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst thereof. (Is. 19:1)\nPrayer:\n\nO most watchful Guardian of the Incarnate Son of God, glorious St. Joseph, what toil was your in supporting and waiting upon the Son of the most high God, especially in the flight into Egypt!
